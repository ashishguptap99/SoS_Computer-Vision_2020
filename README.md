In this project, I have implemented custom object detection by fine-tuning the YOLO v3 model, with human head images. I took the pre-trained Darknet-53 model, which is basically trained on the MS COCO dataset containing 80 classes and trained on custom images of human heads in order to calculate the crowd density.
